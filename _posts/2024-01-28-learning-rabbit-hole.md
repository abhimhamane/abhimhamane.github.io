I find myself chasing after the next best thing: data structures and algorithms, Linux, Julia, signal processing, etc... The accessibility to learning content online and the lectures/tutorials on YouTube provide an instant dopamine hit from learning new stuff.

But in reality, lack of knowing is not the problem. Execution is the main hurdle. Knowing limited stuff in detail is better than knowing a lot only at the surface level. Investing time in particular things at once only leads to skills and insights. I'm trying not to go into this learning rabbit hole, which is just a glorified form of procrastination that feels productive but is equally detrimental, if not more.
