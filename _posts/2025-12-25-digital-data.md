Recently I had been thinking about the data I produce and how to store it to be able to access it across multiple systems and also in time. This took me into rabit hole of storage media, backup strategy, cloud storage, network attached storage (NAS), hard drives, solid state drives, revival of CD/DVD readers/writers and much more.

# Storage media
## Life expectancy of storage media
- usually the average life lies on a normal distribution and 

## Failure scenarios
- Hard drives are essentially mechanical. A spinning platter and a reader head, the fast rotation of platter combined with radial motion of reader head allows random read and write. All controled by the onboard control board. So, if the rotor motor fails or the reader head slams into something or electronic issue with control board the drive will fail. The question is can data still be recovered?

- SSDs can loose data if not powered on regularly. The JEDEC memory standards [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC_memory_standards) requires SSD to retain data for 365 days when powered off and stored at 30 deg Celcius.

- USB drives/memory drives work same as SSDs.


## Key
Constantly replicating data to maintain it.
