# PC Building in late 2025

For the history, this is the time when RAM prices are going out of the roof. A 32 GB kit of DDR5 6000MHz can set you back anywhere from 300 - 400 euros. And I have decided to build a PC in this time, what a great start!

So let's set things up. I own an old gamming laptop specifically Dell G3, i5 8th gen with a 1050TI 4 GB VRAM and upgraded to 32 GB of DDR4 2666 MHz (recently) and running Linux Mint. It's great for everyday use, but the processor is showing it's age and the thermals are not good even after changing it's fans thrice and recently repasting both CPU and GPU. I bought this one back in 2018 for my college and it was really good and quite expensive purchase back then, but it sure lasted a while.

I feel now is again time to upgrade and get a better machine for work and play. My idea with this is to have hardware and OS flexibility. This automatically rules out Apple with their Macbooks and Mini desktop computers. There's also another reason to rule them out and that comes from my work reason [cite paper]. So this narrows down to either an Intel or AMD laptop or desktop or the newer mini-PCs.

The non-negotiables
1. OS Flexibility -> shoul run Linux
2. Hardware flexibility -> should allow upgradibility, RAM, CPU, storage, GPU
3. GPU computing - Support FP64 computations at hardware level

Trade-offs
1. Portability - this is counter-intuvite
2. Cost - RAM price uncertainity


## Tradeoffs
Why portability?
- I initially thought to get another gaming laptop. A similar price range as my old one maybe a little upgrade maybe better screen or softer fan or less weight or more professional asthetic. Not a huge fan of gammer asthetic either. But these were way out of my budget all above 2k euros. And the ones in my budget - Legion, LOQs, Victus etc. 

- Second thing with portability and gamming laptop is that it's kind contradiction. They always need power connection to work beyond an hour or two, forget doing anything productive without draning battery (atleast in my experience).
- My use case do not want me to travel a lot and carry compute on the go. I will have a pretty stable living for atleast next one year and hopefully for the next 2-3 years.

- For my portability needs, I'm well equiped with a work laptop (HP ProBook 445 14 inch G11, rocking AMD Ryzen 5 7535U with Radeon Graphics) and is more than enough for writing code, reading papers and using powerpoint. Drawback is that it had HP and Microsoft bloatware.

- RAM price uncertainity and increase -> This is part of life, last couple of years it was GPU shortage, now it's RAM shortage. Can't do anything about it and I feel it's better to get it now, already saved up money (read of satisfying the itch of building a PC first time, which may or may not be a bad financial decision, only time will tell!)

## Non-negtiables
- I have used Linux (Linux Mint) for the last 2 years as my daily driver, initially dual booted with Windows on my Dell G3 and later on as standalone. With Linux gamming becoming ever more accessible and user friendly, I see no reason to stick with Microsoft other than the limitation posed by certain software tools like AutoCAD, SolidWorks or ArcGIS. I do not do much CAD but QGIS is a better alternative and works great on Linux (from experience). Linux saved me from upgrading sooner, back in 2022, my old laptop started signs of slowing down to a point of being unusable, especially when running MATLAB, I then decided to upgrade my ram from measly 8 GB to pleantiful 16 GB. It again slowed down after some windows update, and I have had enough. I decided to dual boot my computer with Linux and it was magic, my laptop felt like new and Linux Mint same as noob friendly as Windows. And never looked back since, had some issues with bluetooth and Discord still sucks on Linux. But it's pretty great all around.

- I guess this leads me to second part of hardware upgradibility. When I bought the old laptop, I didn't knew anything about my requirement, I just knew couple of softwares - SolidWorks, AutoCAD and PhotoShop and they should be supported that's it. Later on went with the recommendation of a family friend. Now I have a better understanding of PC hardware and it's limits (that's more important). I feel a lot of advice online is geared towards max. specs, price-to-performance and raw metrics, the point of hardware limitations is somewhere lost. I feel I have reached the hardware limits on my old laptop with my current work. It's still great for a lot of other things but not my work, and I have other ideas in mind to test with it. So, I want the flexibility for my PC to grow with me. After all, NASA sent bunch of humans to Moon with just 4 KB of RAM and 72 KB ROM (I just have a skill issue - need to learn Assembly!).

- GPU compute - So this is a good to have feature as it's not a dedicated work machine but my tool. Most of my research work is around computation and I can get dedicated hardware if I ask for which is way advanced than any personal computer. So a lot of scientific computing involves something called double precision conputations (FP64 or float64). Any modern CPU will support FP64 operations. This cannot be said about a lot of consumer GPUs though - I did not know about this fact untill recently. A lot of Nvidia consumenr grade GPUs are great at FP32 (single precision) computing as their main focus is gamming. Whereas the theoretical FP64 compute is a fraction of FP32 spport (either 32th or 64th or something). Some say this is intentional to sell their professional series of GPUs, which are way too expensive, there are also TPUs (tensor procession units) that have hardware optimized for matrix multiplication. Also there are datacenter grade GPUs. But anything other than consumer grade is too expensive and way too overkill for my needs.

- So I thought, Apple must be the best as it's super efficient with their integrated memory but the shocker is Apple GPUs do not support FP64 and support for the Apple's Metal API is little. AMD GPUs are great for gaming and similar to Nvidia's offering.

## What's available in the market?

I have been searching for over 2 weeks now. The possible options

1. Custom Linux computers - Framework, Tuxedo computers, Slimbook, Nova Customs -> way to expensive for raw performance, but support to good companies (not at that stage financially)

2. Big brand comsumer offering - LOQ, Legion, Victus, Gigabyte Aero, MSI -> It's good but hard to find something I like -> either too expensive and I loose upgradibility or affordable but under-powered for my requirements

3. Used market -> Not enough experience and fear of scams, possibility to make a frankenstein with used enterprise grade hardware but again skill issue

4. Custom PC built -> Best alternaive and itch to lego assemble parts together


## Components

I hope this feels justified, when I inevetabily regret spending 1300+ euros on this PC.

1. Intel Core Ultra 7 265K with 20 cores (8P + 12E cores) - massive upgrade from previous 4 core 8th gen and future support (assuming Intel does not go bust)
2. Intel Arc B580 12 GB VRAM - best budget GPU with good FP64 support
3. 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5 6000 MHz (expensive)

combined with a compatible ASUS motherboard, ATX case, air cooler and PSU.

## Ideas for older laptop

1. Linux experimenting machine -> experiment with Arch Linux without hampering my work
2. using the unused storage on it as a backup drive using it as a NAS?
